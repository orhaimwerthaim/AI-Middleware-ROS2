[Variables]
external_termination_mode:
  type: integer
  description: The variable to be returned to the external initiator with its current value at the end of the operation. An initial value can be set for it.
  
external_variable:
  type: string
  description: This variable exists at the initiator (e.g., the solver), receives its initial value from the initiator, and can be updated to send information back to the initiator.
  
ros2_persistent:
  type: list
  contains: integer
  description: These variables are used for transferring information between capabilities and are saved at the ROS2 level.
  
ros2_volatile:
  type: float
  description: These variables are intended for internal calculations during the execution of the capability and disappear upon completion.
  
skill_parameter:
  type: string
  description: A value received from the initiator that can be used starting from the pre-execution of the capability code (e.g., for preprocessing).
